### My First Coding Project

This website was my first coding project. I unfortunately didn't use GitHub at the time, so the code is lost â€” though the demo video remains!

The site was built using Django and a dynamic SQL-based backend, allowing users to:

- Add new books to the website
- Register with a username and password
- Submit book reviews
- See top-rated books featured on the homepage

<br/>

I was especially proud of the dynamic features â€” the fact that other users could interact with your uploaded content and boost it through ratings felt exciting and collaborative.

<br/>

### What I Learned

This project helped me:

- Understand Django's structure
- Write and optimize SQL queries
- Get an understanding for UI choices and html/CSS/bootstrap
- Handle user authentication
