This was built using gatsby, initially being based off of a template theme: https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/main/themes/gatsby-theme-jodie. 
This framework was helpful for organizing all of the aspects of the website, especially as I had a lot of images across the website. This framework made it especially
to create a static website to host online on github pages, which is where it resides to this day if you're viewing it. 

Anyways, github here: https://github.com/Landododo/Landododo.github.io
