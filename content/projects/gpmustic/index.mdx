This was my first time seriously messing around with PyTorch and AI. I had a high-level view of the architcture from watching
3Blue1Brown videos on transformers and from taking a mini deep learning class, but had never actually coded a model for any purpose. 

I decided I wanted to try making a generative music model because I have spent a lot of time playing the piano for fun and competetively,
and I had heard that there now existed generative music models. I created a simple pygame piano GUI to view and hear the piano as you play the seed
notes, created a model using the publicly available MAESTRO dataset, and trained the model on my laptop for a couple days (not really utilizing the full
power of the dataset due to computer lacking a GPU and the dataset amounting to 20 million samples).
## Listen to my project ðŸŽ¶

## Takeaways
So I learned a few things from this project:
- Tools like PyTorch are very powerful and make it easy to abstract away the actual model and its training
- Actually obtaining data and processing that data (tokenization) are large parts of machine learning
- Machine learning takes A LOT of compute and time (my laptop with no GPU ran for 2 days and the model was not able to train on the whole dataset because of the amount of computation needed for the 20 million samples)
- Machine learning models need to be modified depending on system specs (VRAM, GPU, CPU, RAM)

Overall, this project was a great introduction to PyTorch and machine learning, and I hope that I will learn more in my machine learning class this semester. I am most interested
in the actual relevance of computer hardware and architcture in machine learning, and this project helped expose how important hardware is in machine learning.
